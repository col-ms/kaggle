    "Great! This printout gives us good insight into how the tweets may vary in their wording, but also how certain words may appear to be disaster related, but also come up in non-disaster tweets. For example, the 8th tweet listed above contains the word \"ablaze\". This would typically be associated with a disaster related tweet talking about a fire. However, here we see it being used in a non-disaster tweet. This sort of occurance is an obstacle in predicting the tweets sentiment, and represents just one type of challenge faced when performing NLP.\n",
